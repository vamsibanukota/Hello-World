# Hello-World
I am new user
Its been almost 7 months after my masters.
But i am still not a professional without anyy employment.
I am getting interview  and loosing it for silly reasons.which made me mad and bored.
But learning some stuff which may useful in life.
Finally, Praying for god show me a better way and give a chance to prove what I am.
